# Notes on Custom Scripts

## CodeIgniter's Layout Library
As we don't want to always load the same Headers, Footers, etc... of the page, we implemented a library to do this for us. The principle is that you add views, that will be stored in the class. Then by simply calling the printPage function with
 ```php
 $this->layout->printPage();
 ``` 
 the whole page will be printed. Note that you can also add a JS, CSS and set the title by simply calling the librarie's methods. See an example in the welcome controler.

 Also, you can set your own default layouts by creating them in the views/layout folder.

 **IMPORTANT: The Layout Library is imported by default, so remove it in autoload if you don't use it !** 

## CodeIgniter CRUD Model
 The file application/core/MY_CRUD.php implements a basic CRUD implementation. (With count option) The easiest way to understand it is to read the file. We highly recommend to use it as a core function for the different models you'll build, by doing so:
 ```php
 class User_model extends MY_CRUD
{
    protected $table = 'users';
}

 ```
