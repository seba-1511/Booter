# Notes on Custom Scripts

## CodeIgniter's Layout Library
As we don't want to always load the same Headers, Footers, etc... of the page, we implemented a library to do this for us. The principle is that you add views, that will be stored in the class. Then by simply calling the printPage function with
 ```php
 $this->layout->printPage();
 ``` 
 the whole page will be printed. Note that you can also add a JS, CSS and set the title by simply calling the librarie's methods. See an example in the welcome controler.

 Also, you can set your own default layouts by creating them in the views/layout folder. By default, there are only 4 of them:
 * **default** Just an empty HTML5 layout
 * **basic** Only main JavScripts and CSS are imported
 * **quicksite** The starting point for a project, with some elements of Bootstrap
 * **mobile** A simple web app with header and footer

 **IMPORTANT: The Layout Library is imported by default, so remove it in autoload if you don't use it !** 

## CodeIgniter CRUD Model
 The file application/core/MY_CRUD.php implements a basic CRUD implementation. (With count option) The easiest way to understand it is to read the file. We highly recommend to use it as a core function for the different models you'll build, by doing so:
 ```php
 class User_model extends MY_CRUD
{
    protected $table = 'users';
}

 ```
## Booter JS
Booter has its own JavaScript Class, found in the file assets/js/booter.utils.js. This file has some functions that I found usefull, and that can be used in about any projects. To use it, just call 
```javascript
booter.theNameOfThePublicMethod();
```

## Configuration
Here are the basic steps you have to do to get your working environment ready:
**PHP**
* Define the base_url var in config.php
* Check the Cookies encryption key, and chenge it.
* Change the DB connection credentials

**JS**
* Change the base_url var in booter.utils.js
